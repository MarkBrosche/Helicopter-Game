# Helicopter-Game
This was a 2-week Unity 3D project for school.
The project was designed to build on familiar concepts like building terrain, animating models and managing a game.  I used models, textures and materials sourced from the Unity Asset store and repositories like sketchfab, but I modeled the terrain, and more importantly wrote the mechanics of the game.  My scripts are loaded here.  

Overall I did not spend any time optimizing my game and so it barely eeks out 60 FPS on a 1080Ti, still it was a fun project and my second significant use of the Unity game engine.
